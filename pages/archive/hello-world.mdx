Welcome to **{NikolasKama}**, my new blog! By the title of this post, I'm positive you're assuming this will be some kind of programming language tutorial, but stay with me. This right here is in fact my very first post in this blog! And no, it's not a boring programming tuts blog for newbies - no worries!

### Woohoo! &#9787;

Thanks for dropping by! Make sure to stay tuned for upcoming *InfoSec* and other *Tech* related posts. Moreover, I will be posting about matters and issues concerning the *Information Security* segment, as well as my personal experiences in the *Cyber Security* world.

Furthermore, I will be sharing with you guys some of my own challenge walkthroughs, code, exploits and much more. Stay put!
