Only one week is left until my first trip to Leipzig, Germany, where I will attend the 34th [Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/tag/34c3/) (a.k.a. **34C3**)!

## Things I am looking forward to

- [SCHINFO](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Assembly:Schinfo) Assembly
- [34C3 CTF](https://34c3ctf.ccc.ac)
- [Volunteering](https://events.ccc.de/2017/11/30/werde-teil-des-34c3-engeln-mit-system/)
- Meeting new like minded people

During the conference, I will be staying with some really cool guys: [xdavidhu](https://twitter.com/xdavidhu), [deantonius](https://twitter.com/deantonious), [spacehuhn](https://twitter.com/spacehuhn) and [seytonic](https://twitter.com/seytonic). We will be hosting our own assembly - [**SCHINFO**](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Assembly:Schinfo); be sure to pass by and say hello!

At our assembly, we will be presenting some of our personal projects (see below) and a group project we have been working on: the **WiFi Satellite** - 14 wifi packet monitoring boards held by a 3D printed satellite-looking holder.

I will also be participating in the **34C3 CTF** event with my new Capture The Flag team: [BanterHunter](https://ctftime.org/team/30635). Moreover, I have signed up as a volunteer and will try to help out the conference in any way possible. If you are also attending 34C3, be sure to [sign up too](https://engelsystem.de/34c3/register). Remember, the conference is [entirely dependent on volunteers](https://events.ccc.de/2017/11/30/werde-teil-des-34c3-engeln-mit-system/).

I am joyfully anticipating meeting you guys there!
