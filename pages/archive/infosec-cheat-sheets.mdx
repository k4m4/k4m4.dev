The tool market is immense making it difficult for someone to remember how every single tool works. Cheatsheets are － without a doubt － the best resource any security professional can refer to when working with tools. (The man page is also a good idea; however, not all tools have one and a cheatsheet is much more brief.)

I recently discovered an awesome link containing a horde of security cheatsheets and I thought I should share it with you guys. So here it is:
